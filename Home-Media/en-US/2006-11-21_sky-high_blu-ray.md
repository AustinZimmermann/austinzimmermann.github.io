### **A Quick Reality Check (2006 Context)**

* **Launch Window:** November 21, 2006, was a huge day for Disney. *Sky High* was actually part of their **first wave** of Blu-ray releases alongside *Eight Below* and *Gone in 60 Seconds*.
* **The PS3 Factor:** The PlayStation 3 had just launched in North America four days earlier (Nov 17, 2006), making this one of the first movies early adopters likely purchased to test their new consoles.
* **Design Trends:** The web back then used a lot of gradients, beveled “glossy” buttons, and blue-tinted backgrounds to look “high-tech”.
