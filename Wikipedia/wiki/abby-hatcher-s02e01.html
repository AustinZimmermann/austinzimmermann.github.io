                <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">“<b>The Peeper Transport Tubes / Abby Loses Her Glasses</b>” is the first episode of the second season of the animated children’s television series <i>Abby Hatcher</i>. It is a standard split episode, containing two eleven-minute segments. It originally aired on Nickelodeon on March 8, 2020.</p>

                <h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>

                <h3 class="font-semibold mt-3 mb-2" id="part1">Part 1: The Peeper Transport Tubes</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">Lex Hatcher installs a new, intricate tube delivery system throughout the hotel, intending to streamline delivery of items. The Squeaky Peepers, the octet of singing Fuzzlies, are instantly thrilled and decide to use the tubes for all their transportation and delivery needs. However, their enthusiasm quickly leads to chaos: they begin mixing up packages and overloading the transport system. This causes a massive traffic jam of Fuzzlies and goods, culminating in an unexpected event where Chef Jeff is pelted with a barrage of blueberries. Abby and Bozzly must use their quick thinking and gear to safely clear the blocked tubes and restore order, teaching the Peepers about responsible use of new technology.</p>

                <h3 class="font-semibold mt-3 mb-2" id="part2">Part 2: Abby Loses Her Glasses</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">While playing soccer, Abby’s glasses are accidentally knocked off her face and are then carried away by various means, passing through different parts of the hotel and into the hands (or tentacles) of other Fuzzlies. Without her glasses, Abby is extremely nearsighted, making it difficult for her to navigate and respond to Fuzzly emergencies. She struggles to perform even simple tasks, relying heavily on Bozzly’s descriptions and her hearing to get around. The plot focuses on Abby’s efforts to find her runaway glasses while continuing to help her friends, demonstrating that she can still be a Fuzzly Catcher even with compromised vision.</p>
