            <p class="mb-4">
                <strong class="font-semibold">Pennington Drive</strong> is a minor north–south roadway located primarily within Hampden Township, Cumberland County, Pennsylvania, United States, serving the eastern residential and light commercial sections of the Mechanicsburg area. Although not a state or county route, it functions as a key local collector road, connecting several large suburban developments to major throughways like U.S. Route 11 (Carlisle Pike).
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                The road is characterized by its curving, tree-lined nature and is predominantly surrounded by single-family homes and townhouses built during the suburban expansion of the 1980s and 1990s. Its primary importance lies in providing access to the eastern periphery of Naval Support Activity (NSA) Mechanicsburg's housing district.
            </p>

            <h2 id="history">History</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
                The initial alignment of Pennington Drive was established in the late 1970s as part of the master plan for the “Winding Creek” and “Rolling Hills” residential developments. The area it traverses was previously agricultural land. The road’s name is speculated to be derived from an early land-owning family in Cumberland County, though specific records linking the name to a historical figure are not widely published.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Its construction paralleled the expansion of the nearby Naval Support Activity, facilitating housing for military families and civilian personnel. The street saw a major resurfacing and pedestrian sidewalk installation project in 2015, which significantly improved its infrastructure.
            </p>

            <h2 id="route">Route Description</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Pennington Drive begins at its southern terminus as a T-intersection with Sporting Hill Road, a key east-west artery. Traveling north, the road quickly enters a densely populated residential zone, with a speed limit consistently set at 25 miles per hour (40 km/h).
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                The most notable segment is its intersection with Sample Street, which marks the transition from purely residential to a mixed-use area featuring a small shopping center and a community park entrance. It continues north, terminating at a four-way junction with Good Hope Road, approximately 0.5 miles (0.80 km) west of the Hampden Township Municipal Building.
