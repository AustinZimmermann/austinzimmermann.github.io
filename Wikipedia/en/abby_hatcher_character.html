    <!-- Introduction -->
    <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
        <strong class="font-semibold">Abby Hatcher</strong> is the main protagonist of the Canadian-American animated children’s television series of the same name. She is an intelligent, energetic, and kind seven-year-old girl who lives with her family in a magnificent hotel. Her primary role is that of a “Fuzzly Catcher” and “Fuzzly Friend”, dedicated to helping and protecting the magical, quirky creatures known as Fuzzlies that secretly reside in her family’s hotel.

        Abby is depicted as resourceful and highly capable of problem-solving. She is notably one-half Chinese on her mother’s side.

    <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2 mb-4 text-gray-800">
        <li><strong>Fuzzly Spotter:</strong> A special wrist device that detects when a Fuzzly needs help. It also possesses various functions for operating equipment within the hotel.</li>

    <p class="mb-4">
        Abby’s closest companion and co-adventurer is <b>Bozzly</b>, a rabbit-like Fuzzly with aquamarine fur. Bozzly is her best friend and partner in solving Fuzzly mishaps. His unique abilities, such as turning invisible and flying by spinning his ears like a propeller, often complement Abby’s high-tech equipment.
